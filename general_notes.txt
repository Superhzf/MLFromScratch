1.Q: Why vectorization is faster than loops?
A:

2. Q: Difference between multiplication functions in NumPy?
A: np.multiply(a, b), element-wise multiplication
np.dot(a, b) == np.matmul(a, b) == a @ b, matrix multiplication

3. Q: What is the difference between NumPy max and NumPy maximum?
A: np.max only works on a single input array and finds the value of maximum
element in that entire array. Alternatively, it takes an axis argument and will
find the maximum value along axis of the input array.
np.maximum is to take two arrays and compute their element-wise maximum
